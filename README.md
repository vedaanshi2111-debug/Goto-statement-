output 
First even number is: 8

Explanation

1. The for loop iterates over the array.


2. When an even number is found, goto found; jumps to the found: label.


3. The program prints the first even number and exits.


4. Without goto, we would need additional flags or break statements.

Description

This program demonstrates the use of the goto statement in C++. The goto statement allows an unconditional jump to a labeled part of the code. In this example, the program searches for the first even number in an array and jumps to a label when it is found.
